# Structure and Dynamics of Complex Networks - Term Project
## Network Robustness Analysis

This repository contains code for my term project for Structure and Dynamics of
Complex Networks, AIT Spring Semester 2016. In this project, I analyze the r
obustness of a number of network datasets to random and targeted attacks using
[Networkx](https://networkx.github.io). The simulation attacks these networks in
a number of different ways. These are:

* Randomly removing nodes from the network
* Removing nodes in descending order of degree
* Randomly selecting a node, then moving randomly along edges removing neighbors
* Randomly selecting a node, then moving along edges towards the highest-degree
node.

I also compare the results of the attacks on a given network to a comparable
Erdos-Renyi network and a network generated by the configuration model. I plot
the results of these attacks using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) in a
Jupyter Notebook.

## The Networks

* `orgnet` - A small network of a business organization.
* `yeast` - A mid-size network of a yeast transcription protein.
* `wag` - A larger network of word associations.
* `facebook` - An anonymized network of Facebook social circles. Available from
[SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html).
* `enron` - An email network from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
investigation of Enron. Available from
[SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html).
* `faa` - A flight network of the FAA's Preferred Routes Database. Available from
[KONECT](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/maayan-faa).
* `powergrid` - An infrastructure network of the power grid of the western
United States. Available from [KONECT](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/opsahl-powergrid).
* `ecoli` - A biological network of the protein links found in _E. Coli_. Available
from [String DB](htttp://string-db.org)
