# Structure and Dynamics of Complex Networks - Term Project
## Network Robustness Analysis

This repository contains code for my term project for Structure and Dynamics of Complex Networks, AIT Spring Semester 2016. In this project, I analyze the robustness of a number of network datasets to random and targeted attacks using [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io). The simulation both randomly removes nodes from the network and repeatedly removes the highest-degree node from the network. I also compare the results of an attack on a given network to a comparable Erdos-Renyi network and a network generated by the configuration model. I plot the results of these attacks using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).
